## What is Obsidian?
Instead of me explaining what Obsidian is and how to use it, I suggest you visit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbLb6QCK88&list=PL3NaIVgSlAVLHty1-NuvPa9V0b0UwbzBd and watch a few of these free videos.

They walk you through the basics of how Obsidian works and what you can expect in the tool and its files. Go watch those short videos and take notes. Then come back here. Go ahead. I'll wait. âŒ›

### Use the Templates
- I created the [[-- person]] and [[-- domain or ip]] templates to illustrate how you can templatize the information you might need to collect during an investigation.
- Consider creating your own templates for other data you need to collect.
- Modify the existing templates to customize them for your needs.

### Linking Files
- One of the most powerful features in Obsidian is the linking of data through `[[]]` tags or `#`. 
- As you will see in the example case files ([[poi-Allister Kemp]]), Obsidian's ability to link files and tag each with arbitrary tags that YOU make up, is an incredible feature.
- The "Graph View"  (`ctrl-G` or `Cmd-G`) will use those links you create and show you related content. 

### Tasks
- The [[- tasks for example files]] page automatically aggregates all tasks in this vault.
- To make a task or "to do" item, start a bullet with `[ ] WHAT YOU WANT THE TASK TO BE`. Examples can be found [[poi-Isiah Kemp#Username s]] and [[poi-Gabriella Parkington#Residences]]

### Look At The Examples
I created several example notes for you to see just some of the capabilities of this tool and these templates. I suggest starting with your #primary #poi [[poi-Allister Kemp]].
